          <p>
            The Roman Republic emerged in 509 BCE after the overthrow of
            Etruscan kings by Rome's wealthiest citizens, establishing a new
            form of government characterized by assemblies of Roman citizens
            that made decisions on behalf of the population. Roman expansion
            began with a focus on consolidating control over the Italian
            peninsula, slowly eliminating threats and rivals in the surrounding
            regions. The Roman Republic eventually rose to become the dominant
            power in the Mediterranean by the first century BCE after engaging
            in a series of wars and strategic alliances.
          </p>

        <div class="coin-item">
          <img src="images/roman-republic-3.png" alt="Roman Republic Coin 2" />
          <p>
            Roman society was divided between the patricians, the wealthy and
            privileged class, and the plebeians, the common citizens who
            initially had limited political rights. The Roman economy, initially
            based on agriculture, transformed as the Republic expanded its
            territory and engaged in trade. The introduction of a silver coin,
            the denarius, around 211 BCE, facilitated trade and economic
            transactions, and its design often reflected Roman values and
            beliefs, such as military victory, as depicted by images of Roma (or
            Bellona) and the Dioscuri.

          <p>
            The Roman Republic faced internal struggles as ambitious individuals
            sought power and the vastness of the empire strained its political
            institutions. The debasement of Roman coinage, caused by emperors
            reducing the silver content of coins to fund their military
            campaigns, contributed to inflation and economic instability.
            Political turmoil and social unrest escalated, culminating in a
            series of civil wars that ultimately led to the demise of the Roman
            Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire under Augustus in 27 BCE.

          <p>
            The Parthian Empire originated in 247 BCE when Arsaces I, leader of
            the Parni, a nomadic group, conquered the region of Parthia from the
            declining Seleucid Empire. Seizing the opportunity presented by the
            Seleucids' conflict with Ptolemaic Egypt, the Parthian rulers
            expanded their territory eastward and westward. Under King
            Mithridates I, the Parthians established a major royal residence at
            Ctesiphon, which eventually became the capital of their vast empire,
            stretching from the Euphrates to the Himalayas.

          />
          <p>
            Parthia was a multicultural empire with a vibrant society,
            influenced by both Hellenistic and Persian traditions. The Parthians
            controlled a key segment of the Silk Road, facilitating the exchange
            of goods and ideas between East and West, and their economy thrived
            on agriculture and trade. They carefully regulated the production of
            their silver drachmas to maintain their value, and the coins often
            depicted images of the ruling monarch and symbols of Parthian power,
            such as seated archers or horsemen.

          />
          <p>
            y the early 3rd century CE, internal strife and pressure from the
            rising Sasanian Empire weakened the Parthian Empire. In 224 CE,
            Ardashir I rebelled against the Parthian ruler, Artabanus IV,
            leading to the fall of Parthia and the rise of the Sasanian Empire.
            The Sassanians, unlike the Parthians, engaged in constant warfare
            with the Roman Empire, eventually leading to the decline of both
            empires in the face of new threats

            The Mauryan Empire emerged in India around 321 BCE when Chandragupta
            Maurya, with the guidance of his advisor Chanakya, overthrew the
            Nanda Dynasty and established his rule over the kingdom of Magadha.
            Chandragupta strategically expanded his empire westward, taking
            advantage of the power vacuum left by Alexander the Great's
            retreating armies. By 316 BCE, the Mauryan Empire had conquered
            northwestern India and defeated the Macedonian satraps, further
            solidifying its control.

          <p>
            The Mauryan Empire was a powerful and sophisticated state, known for
            its strong central administration and a thriving economy. The
            empire's economy was primarily agricultural, but trade also played a
            significant role. The Mauryans used a standardized silver currency
            called the pana, which facilitated trade and symbolized the empire's
            power and reach. The government implemented a comprehensive tax
            system to fund public works projects, including the construction of
            an extensive road network that connected various parts of the empire
            and promoted trade.

          <p>
            The Mauryan Empire began to decline after the reign of Ashoka, the
            third Mauryan emperor, who ruled from approximately 273 to 232 BCE.
            The empire's decline continued for about 50 years after Ashoka's
            rule, eventually dissolving in 185 BCE with the establishment of the
            Shunga Dynasty in Magadha.
